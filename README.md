# MWA-Sim
This project aims to create an accurate MATLAB simulation for the DSP chain in the [Murchison Wide-field Array Telescope](http://mwatelescope.org/). It is currently in alpha phase.
mainsim.m contains a working demo. Set the appropriate parameters and evaluate the script to perform the simulation.
